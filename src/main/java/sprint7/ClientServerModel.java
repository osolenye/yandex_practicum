        // Internet Protocol (IP) - prepares data to sending and sends it to a receiver
        // Transmission Control Protocol - checks if IP has sent all data to the receiver, if not - sends again.
        // HyperText Transfer Protocol - uses IP and TCP and gives client-server model - e.g. browser receiving HTML page
